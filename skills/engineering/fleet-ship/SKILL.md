description: Orchestrate a fleet of herdr agent panes to ship a multi-chunk backlog in parallel - one labeled pane per chunk (own git worktree), engine-routed (mechanical→pigrok/codex, judgment+review→opus), each chunk plan→TDD→review→merge, tracked on a GitHub Project kanban, advanced by event-driven idle-waiters, dogfooded tracer-bullet after each merge. Use when the user wants to run many build tasks in parallel across herdr panes, act as orchestrator over claude/codex/pi agents, "ship the backlog", "orchestrate the fleet", keep an autonomous overnight build loop going, or fan out a wave-graph of chunks. Builds on herdr-agent-orchestration (low-level pane driving).

# Fleet Ship - parallel herdr orchestration

You are the **orchestrator** (run on opus). Panes do the building; you plan the waves, route engines,
gate reviews, merge, track on a kanban, and dogfood. This skill *composes* our normal ship workflow -
it just runs it across many parallel herdr panes instead of one session.

## Skills this composes (the chain - invoke these, don't reinvent)
- **Drive panes:** `herdr-agent-orchestration` (read FIRST - `agent list/read/send/wait`, `pane send-keys`, `agent start`).
- **Plan:** mechanical chunks → `superpowers:writing-plans` only. Design/ambiguous chunks in *autonomous*
  fleet mode → **parallel design-exploration** (`superpowers:dispatching-parallel-agents` / `design-an-interface`:
  N independent *lens* subagents → 1 synthesizer → an options doc + recommendation, **marked AWAITING-DECISION**).
  Interactive `superpowers:brainstorming` interviews the user - only run it when YOU/the user drive it live, never
  in an unattended pane. (Parallel-explore generates options; it does NOT replace the user's decision.)
- **Build:** `superpowers:subagent-driven-development` (runs `superpowers:test-driven-development` +
  `superpowers:using-git-worktrees` internally). **Seam discipline:** its `testing-anti-patterns.md` is the authority — mock only non-deterministic *leaves* (model/LLM, clock, net), NEVER the code path the test is named after.
- **Review:** `/review-all` = `simplify` + `/codex:review` + `/codex:adversarial-review`; plus
  `superpowers:requesting-code-review` / `superpowers:receiving-code-review` for the judgment on findings.
- **Finish:** `superpowers:verification-before-completion` (gates) → `superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch`
  (PR) → orchestrator merges → `commit` conventions.
- **Dogfood:** `dogfood` (+ `verify` / `run` to launch the app).

Opus panes invoke these directly. **pigrok/codex panes lack the Skill tool → bake the discipline
(plan-first, red→green TDD, gates) into their brief text.** The orchestrator (opus) always owns Review + Finish.

## Setup (once)
1. A **backlog** with a wave-graph (chunks + deps + acceptance). None? build it with `superpowers:writing-plans`
   (after `superpowers:brainstorming` if the shape is unclear). Commit to main so every worktree pane reads it.
2. `herdr status` up. A **GitHub Project** board (`gh project create`) - see [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md).
3. One **idle-waiter** background task per active pane (notification spine - REFERENCE).

## Per-chunk loop
1. **Map FIRST.** `herdr agent list` + `git worktree list`. Never spawn into an occupied worktree or
   duplicate work a user/agent already started. (Live lesson: this bit us.)
2. **Worktree** (`superpowers:using-git-worktrees`): `git worktree add .claude/worktrees/<chunk> -b feat/<chunk> origin/main`
   **then `bun install` (or the repo's install) in the new worktree** - fresh worktrees don't share the root
   `node_modules`, and a pane may skip install → `Cannot find module @workbench/*` gate failures that look
   like code bugs but aren't. Do it at the orchestrator before spawning, so the pane + your gates both resolve.
3. **Spawn, engine-routed + NAMED:** `herdr agent start <chunk-id> --cwd <worktree> --workspace <ws-id> -- <engine argv>`
   — the agent NAME is the kanban chunk id. First `herdr workspace create --label <chunk-id> --cwd <worktree> --no-focus`
   and use the `workspace_id` from its response, so the human's sidebar shows one labeled workspace per chunk.
   Engines: mechanical → **pigrok** `pi --model xai-oauth/grok-4.3 --approve` or **codex**
   `codex --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`; judgment/reactor-subtle/design → **opus**
   `claude --model opus --dangerously-skip-permissions`. **ALWAYS pin `--model` explicitly** — a bare `claude`
   inherits the user's CURRENT default, which can change mid-fleet (live lesson: user switched their default to a
   new model and the next spawned pane silently ran on it; caught only by reading the pane status line).
4. **Brief** (literal `agent send`, then a separate `pane send-keys Enter`): PLAN first
   (`superpowers:writing-plans`) → BUILD via `superpowers:subagent-driven-development` (TDD) → gates
   (`superpowers:verification-before-completion`: `bun run typecheck` 0, `verify:effect` 0, suites green) →
   **Run `git add -A && git commit` before STOP, then report; do NOT push/PR/merge** (an uncommitted worktree = UNFINISHED to the waiter; panes are inconsistent about self-committing). **Seam rule in every brief:** point the pane at `testing-anti-patterns.md`; a behavior-bearing chunk must assert the *observable effect at the real seam* (e.g. the repo's `e2e-*.test.ts` /rpc pattern — the goal actually appears), NOT that a mocked dispatch was called. Non-Claude panes: bake plan-first + red→green TDD into the brief.
5. **Arm waiter.** Background `herdr agent wait <name> --status idle` (re-arming) → re-invokes you on idle.
6. **Gate (you, opus).** On idle: read the pane → `/review-all` → **seam check** (the
   `superpowers:requesting-code-review` task-reviewer rubric already asks *"tests verify real behavior, not
   mocks?"* — enforce it; heuristic: *delete the mock — if the test still passes, it tests the mock, not the
   code*; a behavior-bearing chunk with only mocked-dispatch tests is NOT done → send back) →
   `superpowers:receiving-code-review` judgment → one fix subagent for Critical/Important →
   `superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch` → **squash-merge to main.**
7. **Track.** Move the kanban card Todo→In Progress→Done; attach the PR.
8. **Dogfood (tracer-bullet).** After a runtime-affecting merge, when test panes are quiescent, spawn an
   opus `dogfood` pane: run the app, exercise the chunk's new behavior + a core smoke, report → findings
   become **new kanban cards** linked to the chunk.
9. **Fan out.** Spawn the next wave's *independent* chunks in parallel; sequence shared-file/reactor chunks.

## Context hygiene (you, the orchestrator) - keep yourself clean + resumable
Your state lives in the **ledger + kanban + git**, NOT your context. So you survive compaction and a fresh
orchestrator can resume from those alone.
- **Per wake, re-derive from sources of truth** (`cat <ledger>`, `gh project item-list`, `git log`,
  `herdr agent list`) - do NOT trust memory.
- **Read pane *tails* only** (`agent read --lines 30`), never full transcripts. Never `cat` a subagent
  `.output` transcript into context.
- **Offload bulk to files:** diffs via `review-package`, pane reports + briefs as files, review verdicts
  returned terse. Read the *verdict*, not the diff.
- **Each wake is small + stateless:** read tail → gate (`/review-all`) → merge → move card → spawn next →
  append one ledger line → done. Don't accumulate; the board + ledger are the memory.
- Spawn the *building* on panes; keep heavy reading/searching in **subagents** (they return conclusions,
  not file dumps), so your window holds coordination only.

## Hard rules (live-dogfood lessons)
- **One agent per worktree.** Map before spawning. **Never interrupt a `working` pane;** clear prompt
  before `send`; submit is a separate `send-keys Enter`.
- **Name everything; report by name.** `agent start <chunk-id>` — the name IS the chunk id, unique per fleet
  (never generic like `codex`: detected labels are also targets → ambiguous). ALL `herdr agent *` commands
  (get/read/send/wait/rename/focus/attach) accept the NAME as target; address by name everywhere. Pane id is
  required ONLY for `herdr pane *` (send-keys/run/close) and `herdr wait output|agent-status` — resolve once:
  `herdr agent get <name> | jq -r .result.agent.pane_id`. REPORTING rule: to the human always say
  `<name> (<pane_id>)` — e.g. `dv-record-detail (wV:pC)` — never a bare pane id.
- **Idle != done — and `done`, not `idle`, is how panes often END.** Codex chunks finish in status `done` (terminal); gate on `idle|done`, never `= idle` alone (else the waiter loops past a finished pane to TIMEOUT). `herdr agent wait --status idle` is LEVEL-triggered (returns instantly if already idle → no backpressure); herdr has no native turn-finished event. A pane can finish **gated-green but uncommitted** → gate on stable-idle AND (commit OR dirty tree); on idle+dirty the orchestrator commits the pane's work itself (`READY_UNCOMMITTED`). See REFERENCE 'Refinement 2'.
- **Idle != done (background-shell flap).** A pane reports idle/`done` while merely *holding on a background shell* (a test suite,
  a forked review). Gate on a REAL signal: a **commit beyond `origin/main`** + a final report/STOP - not bare
  idle. Make the waiter **commit-gated** (re-arm until a commit appears). Live lesson: a pane mid `+2292/-11510`
  with the suite running flapped `idle`→`working`, storming the naive idle-waiter.
- **Non-Claude panes miss repo conventions Claude Code auto-absorbs — point them at CLAUDE.md; the gate catches the rest.** Grok wrote
  `import from "bun:test"` + `toStartWith` in a vitest repo: **typecheck + verify:effect PASSED**, but the
  test file failed to load → 0 tests ran. So (a) name the repo's test framework + matcher set in the brief
  (e.g. "vitest, import from 'vitest', no bun:test/toStartWith"); (b) the orchestrator's gate must
  **actually run the new tests** - typecheck/verify alone pass over a non-loading or wrong-matcher test.
- **Green != correct — enforce SEAM discipline (define_view dogfood lesson).** A chunk shipped 31 green unit
  tests yet the feature hung in prod because they **mocked the dispatch (`CreateGoal`) — the behavior under
  test**; "green" meant "called the mock." The rules already existed (`testing-anti-patterns.md` + both review
  rubrics ask *"tests verify real behavior, not mocks?"*) — the miss was not wiring them into the fleet. So:
  (a) every brief names the seam rule + points at `testing-anti-patterns.md`; (b) the gate runs the seam check
  (delete-the-mock heuristic + task-reviewer rubric) and REJECTS behavior-bearing chunks whose tests mock their
  own dispatch; (c) such chunks carry a real-seam acceptance assertion (mock only non-deterministic leaves).
  UAT/dogfood is the backstop, not the primary catch.
- **Orchestrator gates the merge** - panes never auto-merge to main (checkpoint + avoid collisions).
- **Event-driven, not timed.** `herdr agent wait` background tasks are the notifier; `send_later`/
  `ScheduleWakeup` may be unavailable (no CCR session). If herdr can't track an engine's status, fall that
  chunk back to one it can (codex/claude). **Engines run out of credits/quota mid-run** (grok hit a
  `403: run out of credits`, pane frozen) - detect via a pane read, close the dead pane, and re-spawn the
  chunk on a fallback engine (grok→codex→opus) in the SAME already-installed worktree. Keep >1 lane funded.
- **Parallelize only within a wave where chunks don't share files.** **Verify "already done" claims**
  against current code before building (recent merges shift things).

See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for brief templates, kanban `gh` commands, the waiter script, engine flags.
